Notes for installation

On Minitel Pi
start_minitel.sh calls getty_mntl.sh so that the Minitel can log in to start minitel_simple_serverv2. The processing sketch TweetToOSC.pde
must be started on the Pi itself.
You will have already installed Processing for this to run as well as downloading OSC.

On VX project
go.sh merely starts mplayer to run the videos.
